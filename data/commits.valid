for a service to shutdown before a kill signal is sent  resulting

__label__features "enable validation of optional values

to validate values contained in an `optional` type  we need to use a new
feature in hibernate validator 5 . 1  so this introduces a dependency
version bump to 5 . 1 . 1 . 

this makes use of an *experimental* feature in hibernate validator  so
i ' m not 100% sure we ' ll want to make use of it yet . 

to validate the contents of an `optional`  you need to include an
`@unwrapvalidatedvalue` annotation on the property being validated:

```java
@length ( min = 32  max = 32 ) 
@unwrapvalidatedvalue
private optional<string> md5 = optional . absent (  ) ;
```

absent values are considered `null` when validated  so their behaviour
depends on your chosen constraints '  handling of `null` values . 

we have to register this inside `bootstrap`  and i noticed that we don ' t
 ( currently )  expose a way for users to register more validation behaviour
through `bootstrap`  so we should probably look in to that . "
